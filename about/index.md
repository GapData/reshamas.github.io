I am a freelance data scientist/statistician and MBA with skills in Python, R and SAS. I worked for over 10 years as a biostatistician in the pharmaceutical industry.  I'm also an organizer of the meetup group [NYC Women in Machine Learning and Data Science](wimlds.org). I have an MS in statistics from Rutgers University and an MBA from NYU Stern School of Business.

What I love:  yoga, reading books, the French language, movies, NYC life
