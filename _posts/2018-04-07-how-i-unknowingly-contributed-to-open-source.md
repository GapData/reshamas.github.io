## How can you be a sponsor? 

The best way to thank those who have helped you is to "pay it forward." When you start to get more influence and opportunities, it becomes your responsibility to help pull others up behind you. For example, if you're a seasoned speaker, think about recommending others for opportunities, especially when you can't go yourself, like Julia Evans recently did:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get email about a lot of speaking opportunities. if you&#39;re looking to give more talks (especially if you&#39;re from a marginalized group), reply to this with a link to a video of a talk you&#39;re proud of!</p>&mdash; üîéJulia Evansüîç (@b0rk) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/960884397644898305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2018</a></blockquote>

For more ideas, Caitlin Hudon has a great twitter thread: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Below are examples of &quot;good guys in tech&quot; and things they have done that have helped my career. I hope others can follow their example.</p>&mdash; Caitlin Hudonüë©üèº‚Äçüíª (@beeonaposy) <a href="https://twitter.com/beeonaposy/status/895799250055024640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

Some examples she gives include colleagues praising her work in front of her boss, sharing their salary information with her, and promoting the work of women, including by doing something as seemingly small as tweeting about it. When Caitlin started RLadies Austin, she had men reaching out to offer their time, training materials, meeting spaces, and promotion of the meetup.

## Take 1 :clapper:

Like many data scientists, I thought that ‚Äúopen source contribution‚Äù meant creating a new library in Python.  That would require knowledge of objects, inheritance, parallelism, asynchronous, classes, methods, decorators, and more to write that long, complex code.  But, I‚Äôm a statistician and that level of Python/computer science is beyond my scope of knowledge.  

In early 2017, [Andreas Mueller](https://twitter.com/amuellerml), who is the core maintainer of the Python analysis library [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) and co-author of [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do) reached out to me to organize a sprint for my meetup group (NYC Women in Machine Learning & Data Science) to increase the participation of women in open source.  A 2013 survey found that only 11 percent of open-source contributors were women.  There is more background in this article [And Now, an Infuriating Statistic about Women and Coding](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/111/and-now-an-infuriating-statistic-about-women-and-coding/).   After much planning, the event, [Scikit-learn Sprint](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Women-in-Machine-Learning-Data-Science/events/237123181/) was scheduled, the [scikit-sprint GitHub repo](https://github.com/WiMLDS/scikit-sprint) was set up, prep work was created for participants, teaching assistants were recruited, [Gitter](https://gitter.im/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) was introduced, breakfast was ordered‚Ä¶  All details were meticulous choreographed.  I was very excited for this event for many reasons: to involve a community of users (particularly women) in open-source, to make a dent in the [700+ open issues at the time (now 1000+)](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues), and for me to contribute by submitting a pull request to a critical Python library.  

And, after all that planning, I was unfortunately unable to attend due to a severe ankle injury.  My dreams of contributing to open source in March 2017 were crushed.  Perhaps next time.  


## What is Open Source

Open source has traditionally been known as:  
>free software whose source code is open to the public  

Examples include:  
- Linux operating system
- [Apache projects](https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?name)
- [NumFocus Sponsored Projects](https://www.numfocus.org/sponsored-projects)
- more [programming languages](https://github.com/collections/programming-languages)
- browsers (Firefox, Mozilla)
- text editors
- & even more [open source applications](https://opensource.com/resources/projects-and-applications)

In November 2017, I participated in the inaugural [Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC)](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/diversity-inclusion/disc-unconference-2017/), specifically the sub-committee on [Getting Started with Open Source](https://github.com/numfocus/getting-started-with-open-source) where I expanded my knowledge of open source.    

We can widen the definition of open source to include the following contributions:
- creating additional libraries for programming languages
- contributing to programming languages by fixing bugs or adding features via GitHub
- documentation
- tutorials and training materials
- blogs
- research papers
- answering user questions on forums such as StackOverflow and Quora
- useful tweets
- talk slides and videos
- datasets
- [trending repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/trending)

An updated definition could be:  
>Free software whose source code is open to the public, as well as any documentation, examples, applications, maintenance and support of software and related tools for all users.

 

## Why Contribute to Open Source
Because everyone uses it, benefits from it, and there‚Äôs a lot of work to be done.  Other advantages include:  
- learning a skill by contributing
- sharing work
- augmenting your portfolio by including your OS contributions
- networking opportunities

There is more information available in this dossier, [Getting Started with Open Source](https://github.com/numfocus/getting-started-with-open-source) which is an outcome of the DiSC Unconference.


## Take 2 :clapper:

[fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai) was founded by Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas with the goal of making deep learning (DL) accessible to the masses.  Fortunately and most importantly, the program also allows those who are interested but not based in San Francisco an opportunity to attend the lectures online and it makes available all course materials including an active and vibrant Discourse community.  I learned of the [fastai International Fellowship](http://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/international-fellowship/) (for the Fall 2017 class) though a data science connection of mine  just 2 days before the deadline to apply.  I applied and I am happy to say, I was accepted!  There were approximately 300 students attending in person and 400 International fellows participating online.  

My personal experience in data science (both as a student and teacher) is that Dev Ops can be a barrier to entry.  Dev Ops are those skills needed to set up a workable environment even before doing any data science.  It includes skills in:  Git, setting up a machine in the cloud (via AWS or Paperspace or a myriad of other options), configuration, navigating bash and editor on a terminal on the cloud machine, downloading images and transferring them to a cloud machine.  It is separate from the machine learning part.  Beginner data scientists often struggle with these dev ops skills.

Initially, while enrolled in this online course, I took notes in google docs for myself.  After a week or so, I decided to create a repo on GitHub,  [fastai_deeplearn_part1](https://github.com/reshamas/fastai_deeplearn_part1), and share my notes in case a *few other students* might find them helpful.  

To date, almost 400 users have starred this repo, and thousands have referenced the documents.  

I contributed to open source!

## Conclusion & Inspiration

I live in the United States, specifically New York City.  It‚Äôs a time period where any topic under discussion is inherently divisive.  I am reminded of Charles Dickens‚Äô famous lines:  

< insert image of Charles Dickens here>

What I love about data science is the passion that all who are bit by the data bug bring to it.  Data science ignores artificial boundaries, nationalities, profession, religion, languages and time zones.  I have benefited from the work and tools of many contributors to build my data science skills, and I have been happy to give something back to the community.  It‚Äôs been enormously gratifying to create and share this repo which enables so many aspiring and practicing data scientists to manage dev ops tools and move forward to continue deep learning.  That‚Äôs the true depth and value of open source.  It really is open to everyone.  

## What the Future Holds
All data scientists use open source tools.  I foresee a section on the resume entitled ‚ÄúOpen Source Contributions‚Äù where folks will include how they‚Äôve contributed to open source.
