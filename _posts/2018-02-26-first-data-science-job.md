# How Do I Get My First Data Science Job?

## Intro
As an organizer for a data science meetup group, I am often asked this question:  
>*I am studying data science [either university degree or bootcamp or self-study].  How do I go about getting my first job in data science?*

There are some key steps:  
1.  Showcase your work
2.  Participate in the community
3.  Be connected
4.  Find the opportunities

## Portfolio
The advantage, of living at a time when technology and social media are accessible, is that there are so many opportuntities to showcase your portfolio.  Here are the aspects of your portfolio that you have direct control over and which you can use to represent you and your work, hence your "brand":  
- Resume
- LinkedIn profile
- GitHub repository
- Blog
- Twitter profile
- Kaggle profile

Make sure your accounts show your **full name** with a professional photo.  Use technology to your advantage -- being anonymous on the internet makes it really challenging for employers to find and research you.  They'll just move along to the next candidate.  

Check out the blog by [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel) entitled [Making Peace with Personal Branding](http://www.fast.ai/2017/12/18/personal-brand/).  There is sage advice there on:  
- Why personal branding is useful
- Making peace with personal branding
- Twitter for beginners
- Speaking at conferences / meetups
- Public speaking resources

### [Kaggle Competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
Participating in Kaggle competitions has a lot of benefits:  
- there's a friendly community
- there are *kernels* (code that others share and showcase) that can help you get started
- you can work with others in a team
- you become familiar with popular datasets

You can set up your public profile to share and showcase your work.  It's also a lot of fun.  

### Blogging
There are some data scientists on Twitter that are committed to promoting new bloggers.  Check out [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob)'s blog [Advice to aspiring data scientists: start a blog](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)

### Showcase Your Work
Sharing your work, particularly in data science, where the community relies on open source software, is a great way to show your sklls.  Whether it's Kaggle competitions or projects, make your code available in a GitHub repository and write a corresponding blog.  Employers *do look* at GitHub accounts of candidates to see their GitHub activity, coding level and projects.

## Networking
Networking is critical.  A definition of networking is:  
>*interact with other people to exchange information and develop contacts, especially to further one's career.*   

But it's so much more complicated than that.  [Emily Robinson](https://twitter.com/robinson_es) has written a couple of insightful blogs on what networking really is, and how to do it effectively:  
- [Building Your Data Science Network: Finding Community](https://robinsones.github.io/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Finding-Community/)
  - meetups
  - twitter
- [Building Your Data Science Network: Reaching Out](https://robinsones.github.io/Building-Your-Data-Science-Network-Reaching-Out/)
  - offer value
  - find a connection
  - follow-up

Emily has also written a post entitled [Sponsorship](https://robinsones.github.io/The-Importance-of-Sponsorship/) which discusses her experience in getting her first data science job.  

### Classroom
When in a formal educational program, make sure to speak and connect with everyone, not just the folks you feel most comfortable hanging out with.  Make sure your professors/instructors know your name.  Get to know every Teaching Assistant in the classroom.  Get to know all of your fellow classmates.  Every person has different strengths and networks and skills and something to offer, *including you*. 

### Twitter
If you're new to twitter, here are some of my favorite twitter accounts to follow.  Follow who they follow, follow the insightful (and sometimes fiery) conversations on data science, and build your network:  
- [@hmason](https://twitter.com/hmason), Hilary Mason
- [@mathbabedotorg](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg), Cathy O'Neill
- [@wimlds](https://twitter.com/wimlds), Women in Machine Learning & Data Science
- [@math_rachel](https://twitter.com/math_rachel), Rachel Thomas
- [@jeremyphoward](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward), Jeremy Howard
- [@drob](https://twitter.com/drob), David Robinson
- [@robinson_es](https://twitter.com/robinson_es), Emily Robinson
- [@BecomingDataSci](https://twitter.com/BecomingDataSci), Data Science Renee
- [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet), Francois Chollet
- [@dpatil](https://twitter.com/dpatil), DJ Patil
- [@AndrewYNg](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg), Andrew Ng
- [@mrogati](https://twitter.com/mrogati), Monica Rogati

Participate...by liking tweets, retweeting or contributing to a conversation.

## Education
With 12-week bootcamps costing about $16K these days, and 2-year university graduate programs costing significantly more, do your research.  Find out what the **placement statistics** are and what **resources** they offer to entry level analysts / data scientists.  
- Are there opportunities for internships or small projects?  
- How extensive is their alumni network?  
- Reach out to alumni of the bootcamp (via LinkedIn) and ask about their experience in the program as well as job placement support and to get the inside scoop.

## Underground Resources
Almost every meetup group or organization has a community Slack team you can join.  You can find this information in their announcements, join their Slack teams and watch out for the job postings.  

Subscribe to data science newsletters.  Here's a list of [7 awesome data science newsletters to keep you informed](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/data-science-newsletters/).

Read your emails.  Meetup groups and newsletters regularly post job opportunities that are more "real" than the postings that appear in the well known job boards such as LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.

## Managing Expectations
If the title is Analyst or "Junior Data Scientist", and it allows you the opportunity to use and refine the data science tools you've learned, that is most important.  Your first data science job may not be the job of your dreams.  You may not have the exact title you envisioned.  Think of it as a learning experience and stepping stone.  As long as you are moving in the right direction, that is good progress.
